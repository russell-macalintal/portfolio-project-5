Learn.co Portfolio Project 5

This is a Single Page Javascript Application that takes advantage of the React and Redux libraries to respond to, save, and store state changes. In addition, it utilizies the Redux-thunk middleware to send to and receive data from a Rails API database, while employing client-side routing through React-router.

In essence, this application is a variant of a Blog-Post application that is built around the concept of an idea-sharing community. Users are free to post game concepts and storylines to the forum where other users can provide comments and feedback.


## INSTALLATION

- Clone the repository
- Open the application folder and navigate to the '/backend-api' directory
- Run 'rails db:migrate' and 'rails db:seed' in the terminal to obtain a clean database with test seed information
- Run 'rails server' to initiliaze the backend API
- Navigate to the '/game-ideas' directory
- Start the application using 'npm start' in the termainal

*Note - When launching the application, use the address generated by the terminal labeled "On Your Network". Simply navigating to 'http://localhost:3000/' will direct you to the Rails API server, not the React JS application.
